                <p class="AboutPageText">Our mission at Delta Protection is to provide a comprehensive, tightly secured password hub for users to have peace of mind while accessing their 
                    personal account information. The objective of the application is to start a new level of authentication while being a top-of-the-line password hub. 
                    To stand out from the competition we plan to have 3 factors of authentication before being able to view the username and password. Another top feature we are going to have 
                    is before choosing the password you want you can hit the hotlink that after completing the authentication steps, it will automatically bring you to the website. </p>
